Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.


算法
(双指针扫描) O(n)
用两个指针 i,j分别从数组首尾往中间扫描，每次将 i 后移一位，然后不断前移 j，直到 numbers[i]+numbers[j]≤target 为止。如果 numbers[i]+numbers[j]==target，则找到了一组方案。

时间复杂度分析：两个指针总共将数组扫描一次，所以时间复杂度是 O(n)
