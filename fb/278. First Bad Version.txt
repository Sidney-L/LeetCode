You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:

Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 

算法
(二分) O(logn)
整个序列可以分为两段，前半段都是成功的版本，后半段都是失败的版本。所以该问题具有二分性质，直接二分即可。

时间复杂度分析：二分检索只会调用 logn 次API，所以时间复杂度是 O(logn)。
If you are setting mid = (left + right)/ 2​, you have to be very careful. Unless you are using a language that does not overflow such as Python, left + right could overflow. One way to fix this is to use left + (right - left)/2 instead.
