Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.


Pre order traversal of BST will output root node first, then left children, then rightã€‚Because of BST's property: before the |separate line| all the node values are less than root value, all the node values after |separate line| are greater than root value. We will utilize this to build left and right tree.

Pre-order traversal is BST's serialized string. I am doing it iteratively.
To deserialized it, use a queue to recursively get root node, left subtree and right subtree.

 time complexity is O(NlogN).worst case complexity should be O(N^2), when the tree is really unbalanced.
