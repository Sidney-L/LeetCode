Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

算法
(递归遍历) O(n)
递归函数的返回值定义为从当前结点到叶子结点的最大长度，当前结点为空返回 -1。
递归时，分别得到左右子树递归的返回值，则可以更新答案 ans = max(ans, d1 + d2 + 2)；然后返回 max(d1, d2) + 1。
时间复杂度
每个结点最多仅被遍历一次，故时间复杂度为 O(n)。
